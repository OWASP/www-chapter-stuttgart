## Welcome

Welcome to _OWASP Stuttgart Chapter_. Our Chapter serves southern Germany particular within the Swabia region as a platform to discuss and share topics all around information and application security.

Anyone interested and enthusiastic about application security is welcome. All meetings are free and open. **You do not have to be an OWASP member**.

Referrals to this website or to individual meetings to colleagues or acquaintances are welcome.

## Upcoming Events

## Information about Stuttgart Chapter Events

### When?

We will be running quarterly chapter meetups with the option to have additional events such as hands-on workshops. 

The dates will be picked randomly to avoid recurring conflicts with other events (meetups, private obligations, holiday etc.). Typically, we choose a day from Tuesday to Thursday for our events, as our experience in organizing them has shown that Mondays and Fridays often have a very high no-show rate. ðŸ˜¬

Events usually start at 18:00 with guests arriving and socialising. By 18:30, we proceed with the talk from our guest speaker or dive into the planned activities for the evening.

### Where?

All our upcoming events are announced on Meetup:

### Call for Speakers and Volunteers

### Etiquette

Please note that vendor pitches are not allowed, so please adhere to the [OWASP Speaker Agreement](https://owasp.org/www-policy/legal/speaker-agreement) and avoid marketing stunts. Also, please ensure to remove your company logos from all but one "marketing" slide.
