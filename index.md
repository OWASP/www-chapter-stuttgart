## Information about Stuttgart Chapter Events

### When?

We will be running quarterly chapter meetups with the option to have additional events such as hands-on workshops. 

The dates will be picked randomly to avoid recurring conflicts with other events (meetups, private obligations, holiday etc.). Typically, we chose a day from Tuesday to Thursday in the week, since our experience in organizing events is, that Mondays and Fridays have a very high no-show rate ðŸ˜¬

Typically, the event starts at 18:00 with arriving and socialising. Starting at 18:30 with the talk of our guest speaker or whatever we've planned for the particular event.

### Where?

All our upcoming events are announced on Meetup: [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Stuttgart). 

## Organization

### Call for Speakers and Volunteers

### Etiquette

Please note that vendor pitches are not allowed, so please adhere to the [OWASP Speaker Agreement](https://owasp.org/www-policy/legal/speaker-agreement) and avoid marketing stunts. Also, please ensure to remove your company logos from all but one "marketing" slide.
