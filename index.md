## Information about Stuttgart Chapter Events

### When?

We will be running quarterly chapter meetups with the option to have additional events such as hands-on workshops. 

The dates will be picked randomly to avoid recurring conflicts with other events (meetups, private obligations, holiday etc.). Typically, we choose a day from Tuesday to Thursday for our events, as our experience in organizing them has shown that Mondays and Fridays often have a very high no-show rate. 😬

Events usually start at 18:00 with guests arriving and socialising. By 18:30, we proceed with the talk from our guest speaker or dive into the planned activities for the evening.

### Where?

All our upcoming events are announced on Meetup: [Meetup][meetup].

## Organization

### Call for Speakers and Volunteers

**We are looking for presentations for the next OWASP Stuttgart Chapter Events!** If you'd like to give a presentation, conduct a training workshop or volunteer for us, contact us the OWASP Stuttgart Chapter leaders.

### Etiquette

Please note that vendor pitches are not allowed, so please adhere to the [OWASP Speaker Agreement](https://owasp.org/www-policy/legal/speaker-agreement) and avoid marketing stunts. Also, please ensure to remove your company logos from all but one "marketing" slide.
